# Books Shop — React Online Bookstore

A single-page online bookstore application built with **React**. This project is a personal pet-project created to demonstrate practical frontend development skills, modern React architecture, and preparation for real backend integration.

The application simulates a real e-commerce flow for browsing and purchasing books, focusing on clean UI, reusable components, and structured code organization.
