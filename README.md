# Books Shop

A single-page online bookstore application built with **React**. This project is a personal pet-project created to demonstrate practical frontend development skills, modern React architecture, and preparation for real backend integration.

The application simulates a real e-commerce flow for browsing and purchasing books, focusing on clean UI, reusable components, and structured code organization.

## Features

- Browse a catalog of books with dynamic rendering
- Search and filter books
- Simulated cart functionality
- User authentication flow (mocked)
- Multiple pages with client-side routing
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Simulated backend communication using a mock REST API
